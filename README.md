An unfinished website prototype for a japanese restaurant called okami. I did this project to familiarise myself with WebPack and javascript modularisation. Overall learnt a lot while creating this, someday I may actually finish it, so for now it just has 3 pages with placeholder images. Would finish it but I want to move on to react.
